- a embedded rust visualization approach for the genomic alignments and colour coded approach.
- this crate is for shorter alignments such as organelle or bacterial genome alignments.
- For longer alignments, see the other repository long read alignment, which uses a last significant bit with embedded approach to visualize them. 
- rust embedded application for visualization. 
- general note: incase of golang and RUST, please see the last commit message and if the message says final and binary released, means code completed else in development phase.
